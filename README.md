### Plan
#### 1.Build web site for:
- word segmentations: user to input string of sentences and submit then it response with list of words in those sentences.
- words checking: user submit sentences then it response with sentences and some suggestion word
- words contribution: allow user input Khmer words with it function(noun, verb,...) then we use it to train our model

<!--
- Fit word into model
- English, other beside khmer words
- Number

- Read word from file
- Remove space from text
- Splite word into charater
- Fit into Trie node.

- It should know Khmer words or not khmer words(English or other ..)
